Procedure:

- start with initial list of passwords
- run hashcat -stdout with set of rules (say, base64)
- make graph edge between every input password and resulting password and the applied rule
- repeat for every node in the resulting graph, though tacking care not to use a rule on a password again (i.e., where an edge already exists)
